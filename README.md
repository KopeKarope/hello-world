# hello-world
Hey look Ive finally got around to giving this thing a try

ahoy, me name's Archie, and you cannot question my sanity as it has no answers.
I like long walks on the minecraft server, deep meme-trading, holding phones, romance blogs, pruning the code, version dipping and car rides. Call me.
yes I did just parody the hell out of a very cliche dating app description for a joke. It wasn't funny but I'm committing to it like I commit questionable code to my projects
